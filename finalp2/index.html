    <div class="question">
        <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
        <div class="bullet">Before beginning this class, I had absolutely zero knowledge of any of these three subjects. The only programming I knew was Python, and that on a moderately amateurish level.</div>
        <div class="bullet">In regard to HTML, I knew solely that it was the framework behind websites.</div>
        <div class="bullet">I had never heard of CSS before taking this class.</div>
        <div class="bullet">Though I knew of JavaScript, I simply assumed it a subsidiary of the Java language, simply from the name of it. To learn that despite their similar names the two languages were largely unrelated caught me very much off guard.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h2>
        <div class="bullet">When making my portfolio I decided <b>not</b> to use a template. There were multiple reasons for this, as follows:</div>
        <div class="bullet">I didn’t really acknowledge templates as an option when I began working on my portfolio in the midterms. Generally, I used an “act first think later” methodology for completing the assignments. So, when I saw I needed to create a portfolio I simply created the multiple HTML files and threw on everything as needed.</div>
        <div class="bullet">The portfolio formatting that I used was rather simple—merely a header with a few paragraphs below—and so it was largely unnecessary to follow templates. A few <h1> and <p> elements would suffice for my purposes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h2>
        <div class="bullet">A lot of the aspects of the site were somewhat challenging, as it was my first time ever attempting an HTML project of this scale. Still, it was all manageable.</div>
        <div class="bullet">That was, except for specifically the video player on the creative page. It took me about an hour to get that working even in its current primitive form.</div>
        <div class="bullet">As it turned out, there were issues spanning beyond the simple HTML. The video I initially tried to use was saved in an improper format of MP3, and so was wholly unfunctional.</div>
        <div class="bullet">Once I finally debugged that issue, I found a new video to play, which did work, but it took me even more time to get the HTML and CSS working.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>
        <div class="bullet">Before taking DEV109 – Intro to Web Development, my view of web pages was that of ignorance.</div>
        <div class="bullet">Through taking this course and learning through its artifacts and modules, along with the help of the books and W3Schools, I was able to demystify my view on the field.</div>
        <div class="bullet">As I stated before three slides previously, I had no prior knowledge as to any of the framework of webpages, and so my understanding was greatly increased through simply understanding the basics behind HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</div>
        <div class="bullet">I’m now capable of pulling up the source code for a site and parsing through the bog of elements.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
        <div class="bullet">Beyond simple programming advice, there’s a fair bit of general academic recommendations that students should heed.</div>
        <div class="bullet">It’s helpful to read through assignments as soon as they’re published, simply to have an understanding of the work needed to accomplish it. From there you can plan accordingly and allot yourself the necessary time.</div>
        <div class="bullet">Make sure you make proper use of the slack channel to get advice and tips from your peers. Perhaps you may even be able to help them.</div>
        <div class="bullet">If you don’t know how to do something, just Google it. Of course it’s better to get answers from the textbook, the instructor, or your peers, but for simple, one-line issues a simple search is all you need. There’s plenty of information online, especially on W3Schools.</div>
