        <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
        <div class="bullet">Before beginning this class, I had absolutely zero knowledge of any of these three subjects. The only programming I knew was Python, and that on a moderately amateurish level.</div>
        <div class="bullet">In regard to HTML, I knew solely that it was the framework behind websites.</div>
        <div class="bullet">I had never heard of CSS before taking this class.</div>
        <div class="bullet">Though I knew of JavaScript, I simply assumed it a subsidiary of the Java language, simply from the name of it. To learn that despite their similar names the two languages were largely unrelated caught me very much off guard.</div>
