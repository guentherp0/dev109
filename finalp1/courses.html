	<p>List of courses I have taken at Bellevue College, fall quarter of 2024:</p>
	<div class="bullet">
		<p>Precalculus I</p>
		<p>MATH&141</p>

		<p>I knew a good amount of Precalc before taking this class, and most of this was merely solidifying what I already knew. Though I did learn about matrices.</p>

		<p>I had never played badminton before, but I needed a PE credit and it looked interesting. Overall I'd say it's an enjoyable sport, and I'm finally able to serve.</p>
